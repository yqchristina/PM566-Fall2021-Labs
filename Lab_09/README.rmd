```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)

```


```{r}

# Initialize a temporary in memory database
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), ":memory:")

# Download tables
actor <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/actor.csv")
rental <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/rental.csv")
customer <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/customer.csv")
payment <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanceras/sakila/master/csv-sakila-db/payment_p2007_01.csv")

# Copy data.frames to database
dbWriteTable(con, "actor", actor)
dbWriteTable(con, "rental", rental)
dbWriteTable(con, "customer", customer)
dbWriteTable(con, "payment", payment)

# Are there tables there?
dbListTables(con)
```

You can also use knitr + SQL!

```{sqlite, connection = con, output.var="x1"}

PRAGMA table_info(actor)
```

```{r}
x1
```

This is equivalent to using 'dbGetQuery'.

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "PRAGMA table_info(actor)")
```


## Question 1:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor /* adding comments inline */
ORDER by last_name, first_name
LIMIT 5
")

# the LIMIT is same as head() in R to only display first 5 
```


## Question 2:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT actor_id, first_name, last_name
FROM actor
WHERE last_name IN ('WILLIAMS', 'DAVIS')
")

```
## Question 3:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id
FROM rental
WHERE date(rental_date) = '2005-07-05'
")

```
## Question 4:

Part 4.1
```{r}
q <- dbSendQuery(con, "
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount IN (1.99, 7.99, 9.99)
")

# Fetching the results 10 at a time 
dbFetch(q, n=10)
dbFetch(q, n=10)
```


Part 4.2
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5
")
```
Part 4.3
```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT *
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5 AND amount < 8
")
```

## Question 5:

```{r}
dbGetQuery(con, "
SELECT payment_id, amount
FROM payment
  INNER JOIN customer
WHERE customer.last_name = 'DAVIS'
AND payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
")
```


```{r}
dbDisconnect(con)
```
