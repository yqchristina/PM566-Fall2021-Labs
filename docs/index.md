## Question 1: How many sars-cov-2 papers?

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, xpath = "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/span")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)


# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

    ## [1] "114,592"

``` r
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[[:digit:],]+") #alternative
```

    ## [1] "114,592"

## Question 2: Academic publications on COVID19 and Hawaii

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db = "pubmed",
    term = "covid19 hawaii",
    retmax = "1000")
)

# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

## Question 3:

``` r
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)
#alternative: ids_list <- xml2::as_list(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[[:digit:]]+</Id>")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "<Id>|</Id>")
#alternative for pattern: "</?Id>", the "/" is matched 0 - 1 times
```

Getting the abstract of the papers

``` r
publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/",
  path = "entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db = "pubmed",
    id = I(paste(ids, collapse=",")),
    retmax = "1000",
    rettype = "abstract"
    )
)

# Turning the output into character vector
publications <- httr::content(publications)
publications_txt <- as.character(publications)
```

## Question 4: Distribution of universities, schools, and departments

``` r
library(stringr)

institution <- str_extract_all(
  str_to_lower(publications_txt),
  "university\\s+of\\s+(southern|new|northern)?[[:alpha:]-]+|[[:alpha:]-]+institute\\s+of\\s+[[:alpha:]-]+"
  ) 

#Tabulating the results
institution <- unlist(institution)
table(institution)
```

| 34562997 | Variables Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine Hesitancy Amongst Patients with Neurological Disorders.                                                       | <AbstractText Label="INTRODUCTION" NlmCategory="BACKGROUND">Given that the success of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on herd immunity, identifying patients at risk for vaccine hesitancy is imperative-particularly for those at high risk for severe COVID-19 (i.e., minorities and patients with neurological disorders). <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">Among patients from a large neuroscience institute in Hawaii, vaccine hesitancy was investigated in relation to over 30 sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities, via a telephone quality improvement survey conducted between 23 January 2021 and 13 February 2021. <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Vaccine willingness (n = 363) was 81.3%. Univariate analysis identified that the odds of vaccine acceptance reduced for patients who do not regard COVID-19 as a severe illness, are of younger age, have a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, use illicit drugs, or carry Medicaid insurance. Multivariable logistic regression identified the best predictors of vaccine hesitancy to be: social media use to obtain COVID-19 information, concerns regarding vaccine safety, self-perception of a preexisting medical condition contraindicated with vaccination, not having received the annual influenza vaccine, having some high school education only, being a current smoker, and not having a prior cerebrovascular accident. Unique amongst males, a conservative political view strongly predicted vaccine hesitancy. Specifically for Asians, a higher body mass index, while for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), a positive depression screen, both reduced the odds of vaccine acceptance. <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Upon identifying the variables associated with vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with neurological disorders, our clinic is now able to efficiently provide ancillary COVID-19 education to sub-populations at risk for vaccine hesitancy. While our results may be limited to the sub-population of patients with neurological disorders, the findings nonetheless provide valuable insight to understanding vaccine hesitancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 34545941 | Cancer statistics for the US Hispanic/Latino population, 2021.                                                                                                           | The Hispanic/Latino population is the second largest racial/ethnic group in the continental United States and Hawaii, accounting for 18% (60.6 million) of the total population. An additional 3 million Hispanic Americans live in Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanic individuals in the United States using the most recent population-based data. An estimated 176,600 new cancer cases and 46,500 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanic individuals in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2021. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), Hispanic men and women had 25%-30% lower incidence (2014-2018) and mortality (2015-2019) rates for all cancers combined and lower rates for the most common cancers, although this gap is diminishing. For example, the colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rate ratio for Hispanic compared with NHW individuals narrowed from 0.75 (95% CI, 0.73-0.78) in 1995 to 0.91 (95% CI, 0.89-0.93) in 2018, reflecting delayed declines in CRC rates among Hispanic individuals in part because of slower uptake of screening. In contrast, Hispanic individuals have higher rates of infection-related cancers, including approximately two-fold higher incidence of liver and stomach cancer. Cervical cancer incidence is 32% higher among Hispanic women in the continental US and Hawaii and 78% higher among women in Puerto Rico compared to NHW women, yet is largely preventable through screening. Less access to care may be similarly reflected in the low prevalence of localized-stage breast cancer among Hispanic women, 59% versus 67% among NHW women. Evidence-based strategies for decreasing the cancer burden among the Hispanic population include the use of culturally appropriate lay health advisors and patient navigators and targeted, community-based intervention programs to facilitate access to screening and promote healthy behaviors. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer trends and disparities in the Hispanic population should be closely monitored. © 2021 The Authors.

| 34529634 | Disaggregating Data to Measure Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes and Guide Community Response - Hawaii, March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021.                           | Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (1-3). Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations vary in language; cultural practices; and social, economic, and environmental experiences,† which can affect health outcomes (4).§ However, data from these populations are often aggregated in analyses. Although data aggregation is often used as an approach to increase sample size and statistical power when analyzing data from smaller population groups, it can limit the understanding of disparities among diverse Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian subpopulations¶ (4-7). To assess disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian populations, a disaggregated, descriptive analysis, informed by recommendations from these communities,\*\* was performed using race data from 21,005 COVID-19 cases and 449 COVID-19-associated deaths reported to the Hawaii State Department of Health (HDOH) during March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021.†† In Hawaii, COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 population were 1,477 and 32, respectively during this period. In analyses with race categories that were not mutually exclusive, including persons of one race alone or in combination with one or more races, Pacific Islander persons, who account for 5% of Hawaii’s population, represented 22% of COVID-19 cases and deaths (COVID-19 incidence of 7,070 and mortality rate of 150). Native Hawaiian persons experienced an incidence of 1,181 and a mortality rate of 15. Among subcategories of Asian populations, the highest incidences were experienced by Filipino persons (1,247) and Vietnamese persons (1,200). Disaggregating Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian race data can aid in identifying racial disparities among specific subpopulations and highlights the importance of partnering with communities to develop culturally responsive outreach teams§§ and tailored public health interventions and vaccination campaigns to more effectively address health disparities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 34491990 | Using test positivity and reported case rates to estimate state-level COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence in the United States.                                       | Accurate estimates of infection prevalence and seroprevalence are essential for evaluating and informing public health responses and vaccination coverage needed to address the ongoing spread of COVID-19 in each United States (U.S.) state. However, reliable, timely data based on representative population sampling are unavailable, and reported case and test positivity rates are highly biased. A simple data-driven Bayesian semi-empirical modeling framework was developed and used to evaluate state-level prevalence and seroprevalence of COVID-19 using daily reported cases and test positivity ratios. The model was calibrated to and validated using published state-wide seroprevalence data, and further compared against two independent data-driven mathematical models. The prevalence of undiagnosed COVID-19 infections is found to be well-approximated by a geometrically weighted average of the positivity rate and the reported case rate. Our model accurately fits state-level seroprevalence data from across the U.S. Prevalence estimates of our semi-empirical model compare favorably to those from two data-driven epidemiological models. As of December 31, 2020, we estimate nation-wide a prevalence of 1.4% \[Credible Interval (CrI): 1.0%-1.9%\] and a seroprevalence of 13.2% \[CrI: 12.3%-14.2%\], with state-level prevalence ranging from 0.2% \[CrI: 0.1%-0.3%\] in Hawaii to 2.8% \[CrI: 1.8%-4.1%\] in Tennessee, and seroprevalence from 1.5% \[CrI: 1.2%-2.0%\] in Vermont to 23% \[CrI: 20%-28%\] in New York. Cumulatively, reported cases correspond to only one third of actual infections. The use of this simple and easy-to-communicate approach to estimating COVID-19 prevalence and seroprevalence will improve the ability to make public health decisions that effectively respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

This study aims to examine the disparities among US adult men and women. <AbstractText Label="STUDY DESIGN" NlmCategory="METHODS">We used 21 waves of cross-sectional data from the Household Pulse Survey that were collected between April and December 2020 for the study. The Household Pulse Survey was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to document the social and economic impact of COVID-19. <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">The study population included four groups of adults: emerging adults (18-24 years); young adults (25-44 years); middle-aged adults (45-64 years); and older adults (65-88 years). Psychological distress was measured by their Generalized Anxiety Disorder score and the Patient Health Questionnaire. The prevalence of psychological stress was calculated using logistic models adjusted for socio-demographic variables including race/ethnicity, education, household income, and household structure. All descriptive and regression analysis considered survey weights. <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">Younger age groups experienced higher prevalence of psychological distress than older age groups. Among emerging adults, the prevalence of anxiety (42.6%) and depression (39.5%) was more than twice as high as older adults who experienced prevalence of anxiety at 20% and depression at 16.6%. Gender differences were also more apparent in emerging adults. Women between 18 and 24 years reported higher differential rates of anxiety and depression than those with men (anxiety: 43.9% vs. 28.3%; depression: 33.3% vs. 24.9%). <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">Understanding the complex dynamics between COVID-19 and psychological distress has emerged as a public health priority. Mitigating the negative mental health consequences associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, for younger generations and females in particular, will require local efforts to rebuild capacity for social integration and social connection.

Here, we review the role of epidemiological models in understanding evolving epidemic characteristics, including the effects of vaccination and Variants of Concern (VoC). We highlight ways in which models continue to provide important insights, including (1) calculating the herd immunity threshold and evaluating its limitations; (2) verifying that nascent vaccines can prevent severe disease, infection, and transmission but may be less efficacious against VoC; (3) determining optimal vaccine allocation strategies under efficacy and supply constraints; and (4) determining that VoC are more transmissible and lethal than previously circulating strains, and that immune escape may jeopardize vaccine-induced herd immunity. Finally, we explore how models can help us anticipate and prepare for future stages of COVID-19 epidemiology (and that of other diseases) through forecasts and scenario projections, given current uncertainties and data limitations.

| 34406840 | Vaccinations Against COVID-19 May Have Averted Up To 140,000 Deaths In The United States.                                                                                | COVID-19 vaccination campaigns continue in the United States, with the expectation that vaccines will slow transmission of the virus, save lives, and enable a return to normal life in due course. However, the extent to which faster vaccine administration has affected COVID-19-related deaths is unknown. We assessed the association between US state-level vaccination rates and COVID-19 deaths during the first five months of vaccine availability. We estimated that by May 9, 2021, the US vaccination campaign was associated with a reduction of 139,393 COVID-19 deaths. The association varied in different states. In New York, for example, vaccinations led to an estimated 11.7 fewer COVID-19 deaths per 10,000, whereas Hawaii observed the smallest reduction, with an estimated 1.1 fewer deaths per 10,000. Overall, our analysis suggests that the early COVID-19 vaccination campaign was associated with reductions in COVID-19 deaths. As of May 9, 2021, reductions in COVID-19 deaths associated with vaccines had translated to value of statistical life benefit ranging between $625 billion and $1.4 trillion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 34367726 | Predicting the Severity of Disease Progression in COVID-19 at the Individual and Population Level: A Mathematical Model.                                                 | The impact of COVID-19 disease on health and economy has been global, and the magnitude of devastation is unparalleled in modern history. Any potential course of action to manage this complex disease requires the systematic and efficient analysis of data that can delineate the underlying pathogenesis. We have developed a mathematical model of disease progression to predict the clinical outcome, utilizing a set of causal factors known to contribute to COVID-19 pathology such as age, comorbidities, and certain viral and immunological parameters. Viral load and selected indicators of a dysfunctional immune response, such as cytokines IL-6 and IFNa which contribute to the cytokine storm and fever, parameters of inflammation D-Dimer and Ferritin, aberrations in lymphocyte number, lymphopenia, and neutralizing antibodies were included for the analysis. The model provides a framework to unravel the multi-factorial complexities of the immune response manifested in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Further, this model can be valuable to predict clinical outcome at an individual level, and to develop strategies for allocating appropriate resources to manage severe cases at a population level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34355196 | Medical School Hotline: Immunoepigenetic-Microbiome Axis: Implications for Health Disparities Research in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.                        | Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of chronic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, that arises from metabolic dysfunction and are often associated with obesity and inflammation. In addition, the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has further compounded the effect of health inequities observed in Indigenous populations, including NHPI communities. Reversible lifestyle habits, such as diet, may either be protective of or contribute to the increasing prevalence of health inequities in these populations via the immunoepigenetic-microbiome axis. This axis offers insight into the connection between diet, epigenetics, the microbiome composition, immune function, and response to viral infection. Epigenetic mechanisms that regulate inflammatory states associated with metabolic diseases, including diabetes, are impacted by diet. Furthermore, diet may modulate the gut microbiome by influencing microbial diversity and richness; dysbiosis of the microbiome is associated with chronic disease. A high fiber diet facilitates a favorable microbiome composition and in turn increases production of intermediate metabolites named short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that act on metabolic and immune pathways. In contrast, low fiber diets typically associated with a westernized lifestyle decreases the abundance of microbial derived SCFAs. This decreased abundance is characteristic of metabolic syndromes and activation of chronic inflammatory states, having larger implications in disease pathogenesis of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders that once thrived on healthy traditional diets may be more sensitive than non-indigenous peoples to the metabolic perturbation of westernized diets that impinge on the immunoepigenetic-gut microbiome axis. Recent studies conducted in the Maunakea lab at the University of Hawai’i at Manoa John A. Burns School of Medicine have helped elucidate the connections between diet, microbiome composition, metabolic syndrome, and epigenetic regulation of immune function to better understand disease pathogenesis. Potentially, this research could point to ways to prevent pre-disease conditions through novel biomarker discovery using community-based approaches. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34352507 | Trends in psychological distress and COVID-19 incidence across 15 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas in 2020.                                                           | The United States experienced three surges of COVID-19 community infection since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, 2020. The prevalence of psychological distress among U.S. adults increased from 11 % in 2019 to 35.9 % in April 2020 when New York City become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyzing 21 waves of the Household Pulse Survey data collected between April 2020 and December 2020, this study aimed to examine the distress level in the 15 most populated metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our study found that, as the pandemic swept from East to South and soared in the West, 39.9%-52.3 % U.S. adults living in these 15 metropolitan areas reported symptoms of psychological distress. The highest distress levels were found within the Western areas including Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario (52.3 % in July 2020, 95 % CI: 44.9%-59.6 %) and Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim (49.9 % in December 2020, 95 % CI: 44.5%-55.4 %). The lowest distress level was observed in Washington-Arlington-Alexandria ranging from 29.1 % in May 2020 to 39.9 % in November 2020. COVID-19 and its complex ecology of social and economic stressors have engaged high levels of sustained psychological distress. Our findings will support the efforts of local, state and national leadership to plan interventions by addressing not only the medical, but also the economic and social conditions associated with the pandemic.

We sought to evaluate shoulder arthroplasty utilization for fracture during the COVID-19 pandemic and California’s associated shelter-in-place order compared to historical controls. <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We conducted a cohort study with historical controls, identifying patients who underwent shoulder arthroplasty for proximal humerus fracture in California using our integrated electronic health record. The time period of interest was following the implementation of the statewide shelter-in-place order: March 19, 2020-May 31, 2020. This was compared to three historical periods: January 1, 2020-March 18, 2020, March 18, 2019-May 31, 2019, and January 1, 2019-March 18, 2019. Procedure volume, patient characteristics, in-hospital length of stay, and 30-day events (emergency department visit, readmission, infection, pneumonia, and death) were reported. Changes over time were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for usual seasonal and yearly changes and age, sex, comorbidities, and postadmission factors. <AbstractText Label="Results" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Surgical volume dropped from an average of 4.4, 5.2, and 2.6 surgeries per week in the historical time periods, respectively, to 2.4 surgeries per week after shelter-in-place. While no more than 30% of all shoulder arthroplasty procedures performed during any given week were for fracture during the historical time periods, arthroplasties performed for fracture was the overwhelming primary indication immediately after the shelter-in-place order. More patients were discharged the day of surgery (+33.2%, P = .019) after the shelter-in-place order, but we did not observe a change in any of the corresponding 30-day events. <AbstractText Label="Conclusions" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">The volume of shoulder arthroplasty for fracture dropped during the time of COVID-19. The reduction in volume could be due to less shoulder trauma due to shelter-in-place or a change in the indications for arthroplasty given the perceived higher risks associated with intubation and surgical care. We noted more patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for fracture were safely discharged on the day of surgery, suggesting this may be a safe practice that can be adopted moving forward. <AbstractText Label="Level of Evidence" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Level III; Retrospective Case-control Comparative Study. © 2021 American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons.

The Lab democratized NHPI data, developed community infrastructure and resources, and informed testing site and outreach policies related to health equity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34308400 | Understanding COVID-19 dynamics and the effects of interventions in the Philippines: A mathematical modelling study.                                                     | <AbstractText Label="Background" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">COVID-19 initially caused less severe outbreaks in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) compared with many high-income countries, possibly because of differing demographics, socioeconomics, surveillance, and policy responses. Here, we investigate the role of multiple factors on COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines, a LMIC that has had a relatively severe COVID-19 outbreak. <AbstractText Label="Methods" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">We applied an age-structured compartmental model that incorporated time-varying mobility, testing, and personal protective behaviors (through a “Minimum Health Standards” policy, MHS) to represent the first wave of the Philippines COVID-19 epidemic nationally and for three highly affected regions (Calabarzon, Central Visayas, and the National Capital Region). We estimated effects of control measures, key epidemiological parameters, and interventions. <AbstractText Label="Findings" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">Population age structure, contact rates, mobility, testing, and MHS were sufficient to explain the Philippines epidemic based on the good fit between modelled and reported cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. The model indicated that MHS reduced the probability of transmission per contact by 13-27%. The February 2021 case detection rate was estimated at \~8%, population recovered at \~9%, and scenario projections indicated high sensitivity to MHS adherence. <AbstractText Label="Interpretation" NlmCategory="UNASSIGNED">COVID-19 dynamics in the Philippines are driven by age, contact structure, mobility, and MHS adherence. Continued compliance with low-cost MHS should help the Philippines control the epidemic until vaccines are widely distributed, but disease resurgence may be occurring due to a combination of low population immunity and detection rates and new variants of concern. © 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
